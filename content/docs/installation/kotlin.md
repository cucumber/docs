There is no native Kotlin implementation of Cucumber, but you can use [Cucumber-JVM](/docs/installation/java) to write Cucumber tests in Kotlin.

For examples, please see the [kotlin-java8](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/main/cucumber-kotlin-java8) examples on GitHub.

To get started, have a look at this [blog](https://medium.com/@mlvandijk/kukumber-getting-started-with-cucumber-in-kotlin-e55112e7309b).
