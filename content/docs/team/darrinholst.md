I've been a fan, user, and contributor since first hearing about Cucumber at RailsConf 2009 (aka the best one ever).
Started using and fixing some bugs in cuke4duke shortly after. I've more recently been involved with CucumberJS through
maintenance of [protractor-cucumber-framework](https://github.com/protractor-cucumber-framework/protractor-cucumber-framework).
