I started contributing early in the life of cucumber-jvm by basically building the [cucumber-jvm-jruby backend](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm-jruby)
so that a cuke4duke run would go from 20 minutes to 2 minutes. It has come a long way since I did that work :)

I haven't contributed as much since then, but I'm a huge advocate of BDD, and I love what the Cucumber Community is doing.
