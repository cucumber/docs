I'm the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) of the Cucumber project, which I started in 2008. I'm also co-founder of Cucumber Ltd and co-author of [The Cucumber Book](https://www.amazon.com/Cucumber-Book-2e-Matt-Wynne/dp/1680502387) with Matt Wynne. 

I try to stay on top of everything this community is doing and make sure it all hangs together.
