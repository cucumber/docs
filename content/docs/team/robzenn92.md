I started using Cucumber in 2014 to introduce BDD in one of the project I was working on. The same year, my Bachelor's thesis was focused on extending the Cucumber and Gherkin Ruby gems. Since then, I am a proud supporter of Cucumber and TDD and I love to see how this community and this project is growing day by day.
