I was one of the first users of Cucumber in 2008 and joined the core team a year later. I wrote 
[The Cucumber Book](https://www.amazon.com/Cucumber-Book-2e-Matt-Wynne/dp/1680502387) with Aslak, 
first published in 2011, and in 2013 co-founded Cucumber Ltd.

Cucumber was my first open source project, and I'm proud of what a broad and inclusive community we've 
become. I'm always happy to take time to help coach new or aspiring contributors.
