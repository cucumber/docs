I was one of the first users of Cucumber in 2008 and joined the core team a year later. I wrote 
[The Cucumber Book](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition) with Aslak, 
first published in 2011, and in 2013 co-founded Cucumber Ltd.

Cucumber was my first open source project, and I'm proud of what a broad and inclusive community we've 
become. I'm always happy to take time to help coach new or aspiring contributors.
