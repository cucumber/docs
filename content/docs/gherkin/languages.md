In order to allow Gherkin to be written in a number of languages, the keywords have been translated into multiple languages. To improve readability and flow, some languages may have more than one translation for any given keyword.

### Overview
You can find all translation of Gherkin [on GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/gherkin-languages.json).
This is also the place to add or update translations.

A list of the currently supported languages and their keywords can be found below.
