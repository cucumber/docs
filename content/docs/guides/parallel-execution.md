Cucumber-JVM allows [parallel execution](https://cucumber.io/blog/announcing-cucumber-jvm-4-0-0/) across multiple threads since version 4.0.0. There are several options to incorporate this inbuilt feature in a Cucumber project.

- [JUnit](/docs/guides/parallel-execution/#junit)
- [TestNG](/docs/guides/parallel-execution/#testng)
- [CLI](/docs/guides/parallel-execution/#cli)

For each of these options, this tutorial will look at the project setup, configuration settings, execution commands.
