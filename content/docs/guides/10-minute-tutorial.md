In this quick tutorial you will learn how to:

* Install Cucumber
* Write your first Scenario using the Gherkin syntax
* Write your first step definition in {{% text "java" %}}Java{{% /text %}}{{% text "javascript" %}}JavaScript{{% /text %}}{{% text "kotlin" %}}Kotlin{{% /text %}}{{% text "ruby" %}}Ruby{{% /text %}}
* Run Cucumber
* Learn the basic workflow of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

We'll use Cucumber to develop a small library that can figure out whether it's
Friday yet.

Before we begin, you will need the following:

{{% block "java" %}}

- [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
- A build tool. You can choose between:
  - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
  - [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
   - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ)
   - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "kotlin" %}}

- [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html) (Java 9 and higher are not yet supported by Cucumber)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
   - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
   - [IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ)
   - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)
   - [Kotlin Eclipse](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse)

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "javascript" %}}

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- A text editor

Open a terminal to verify that Node.js is installed properly:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

Both of these commands should print a version number.

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "ruby" %}}

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- A text editor

Open a terminal to verify that Ruby is installed properly:

```shell
ruby -v
bundle -v
```

Both of these commands should print a version number.

# Create an empty Cucumber project

{{% block "java,kotlin" %}}
Decide whether you'd prefer to use Gradle or Maven.

**With Maven**

For Maven, we'll start by creating a new project directory with the `cucumber-archetype` 
Maven plugin. Open a terminal, go to the directory where you want to create your project, 
and run the following command:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate                      \
   "-DarchetypeGroupId=io.cucumber"           \
   "-DarchetypeArtifactId=cucumber-archetype" \
   "-DarchetypeVersion={{% version "cucumberarchetype" %}}"               \
   "-DgroupId=hellocucumber"                  \
   "-DartifactId=hellocucumber"               \
   "-Dpackage=hellocucumber"                  \
   "-Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"                 \
   "-DinteractiveMode=false"
```

You should get something like the following result:
```shell
[INFO] Project created from Archetype in dir: <directory where you created the project>/cucumber
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Change into the directory that was just created by running the following command:
```shell
cd hellocucumber
```

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

* **File -> Open... -> (Select the pom.xml)**
* Select **Open as Project**

**With Gradle**

One way to create this sample Cucumber project using Gradle is to convert the above generated Maven archetype into a Gradle project.

Run the following command from the `hellocucumber` directory:

```shell
gradle init
```

Add the following Task to your `build.gradle` file:
```groovy
task cucumber() {
    dependsOn assemble, compileTestJava
    doLast {
        javaexec {
            main = "io.cucumber.core.cli.Main"
            classpath = configurations.cucumberRuntime + sourceSets.main.output + sourceSets.test.output
            args = ['--plugin', 'pretty', '--glue', 'hellocucumber', 'src/test/resources']
        }
    }
}
```
Note that you also need to add the necessary dependencies/configurations to `build.gradle` depending on which version of Gradle you are using.
See the [Build Tools](/docs/tools/java/#gradle) section.

If you have not already, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

* **File -> Open... -> (Select build.gradle)**
* Select **Open as Project**

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "kotlin" %}}

To use Kotlin, we need to add it to our project:

* Add a directory named `kotlin` in your `src/test` directory and mark it as `Test Sources Root`.
In IntelliJ, you can do so by right-clicking on the `kotlin` directory and selecting **"Mark Directory as" > "Test Sources Root"**.
* Create the `hellocucumber` package inside the `kotlin` directory.
* Create a Kotlin class called `RunCucumberTest` inside the `hellocucumber` package. IntelliJ might tell you that Kotlin is not configured; click **"Configure"**.
Your `pom.xml` should now look like this:

```xml

```
* Copy the annotations from the `RunCucumberTest.java` class to the `RunCucumberTest.kt` class.
If you are using IntelliJ, it will offer to translate the Java code to Kotlin code. Otherwise you'll have to write your own.

Your `RunCucumberTest.kt` class should now look like this:
```kotlin
package hellocucumber

import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber
import org.junit.runner.RunWith

@RunWith(Cucumber::class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = ["pretty"])
class RunCucumberTest
```

* Now you can delete the `RunCucumberTest.java` class.
* Create a Kotlin class called `StepDefs` inside the `hellocucumber` package.
* Copy the import statements from `StepDefs.java` to `StepDefs.kt`; you'll need them later.
* Finally, delete the `StepDefs.java` class (or even the `java` directory).

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "kotlin" %}}

To use Kotlin in our project, we need to take some extra steps:

* Add a directory named `kotlin` in your `src/test` directory and mark it as `Test Sources Root`.
In IntelliJ, you can do so by right-clicking on the `kotlin` directory and selecting **"Mark Directory as" > "Test Sources Root"**.
* Create the `hellocucumber` package inside the `kotlin` directory.
* Create a Kotlin class called `RunCucumberTest` inside the `hellocucumber` package and copy the annotations from the `RunCucumberTest.java` class to the `RunCucumberTest.kt` class.
If you are using IntelliJ, it will offer to translate the Java code to Kotlin code. Otherwise you'll have to write your own.

Your `RunCucumberTest.kt` class should now look like this:
```kotlin
package hellocucumber

import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber
import org.junit.runner.RunWith

@RunWith(Cucumber::class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = ["pretty"])
class RunCucumberTest
```


{{% /block %}}

{{% block "javascript" %}}
We'll start by creating a new directory and an empty Node.js project.

```shell
mkdir hellocucumber
cd hellocucumber
npm init --yes
```

Add Cucumber as a development dependency:

```shell
npm install cucumber --save-dev
```

Open `package.json` in a text editor and change the `test` section so it looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "hellocucumber",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cucumber-js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "cucumber": "^{{% version "cucumberjs" %}}"
  }
}
```

Prepare the file structure:

```shell
mkdir features
mkdir features/step_definitions
```

Create a file called `cucumber.js` at the root of your project and add the following
content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: `--format-options '{"snippetInterface": "synchronous"}'`
}
```

Also, create a file called `features/step_definitions/stepdefs.js` with the
following content:

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const { Given, When, Then } = require('cucumber');
```

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "ruby" %}}
We'll start by creating a new directory and an empty Ruby project.

```shell
mkdir hellocucumber
cd hellocucumber
```

Create a `Gemfile` with the following content:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

group :test do
  gem 'cucumber', '~> {{% version "cucumberruby" %}}'
  gem 'rspec', '~> {{% version "rspec" %}}'
end
```

Install Cucumber and prepare the file structure:

```shell
bundle install
cucumber --init
```

{{% /block %}}

You now have a small project with Cucumber installed.

# Verify Cucumber installation

To make sure everything works together correctly, let's run Cucumber.

{{% block "java,kotlin" %}}
**Maven:**
```shell
mvn test
```

**Gradle:**
```shell
gradle cucumber
```
{{% /block %}}

{{% block "javascript" %}}
```shell
# Run via NPM
npm test

# Run standalone
./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js
```
{{% /block %}}

{{% block "ruby" %}}
```shell

Cucumber's output is telling us that it didn't find anything to run.

# Write a Scenario

When we do Behaviour-Driven Development with Cucumber we use *concrete examples*
to specify *what* we want the software to do. Scenarios are written *before*
production code. They start their life as an *executable specification*. As
the production code emerges, scenarios take on a role as *living documentation* and
*automated tests*.

{{% tip "Example Mapping"%}}
Try running an [Example Mapping](/docs/bdd/example-mapping) workshop in your team to
design examples together.
{{% /tip %}}

In Cucumber, an example is called a [scenario](/docs/gherkin/reference#example).
Scenarios are defined in `.feature` files, which are stored in the
{{% text "java" %}}`src/test/resources/hellocucumber`{{% /text %}}
{{% text "javascript" %}}`features`{{% /text %}}
{{% text "ruby" %}}`features`{{% /text %}}
directory (or a subdirectory).

One concrete example would be that *Sunday isn't Friday*.

Create an empty file called
{{% text "java,kotlin" %}}`src/test/resources/hellocucumber/is_it_friday_yet.feature`{{% /text %}}
{{% text "javascript" %}}`features/is_it_friday_yet.feature`{{% /text %}}
{{% text "ruby" %}}`features/is_it_friday_yet.feature`{{% /text %}}
with the following content:

```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"
```

The first line of this file starts with the keyword `Feature:` followed by a name.
It's a good idea to use a name similar to the file name.

The second line is a brief description of the feature. Cucumber does not
execute this line because it's documentation.

The fourth line, `Scenario: Sunday is not Friday` is a
[scenario](/docs/gherkin/reference#example), which is a *concrete example* illustrating how
the software should behave.

The last three lines starting with `Given`, `When` and `Then` are the
[steps](/docs/gherkin/reference#example) of our scenario. This is what Cucumber will execute.

# See scenario reported as undefined

Now that we have a scenario, we can ask Cucumber to execute it.

Cucumber is telling us we have one `undefined` scenario and three `undefined`
steps.  It's also suggesting some snippets of code that we can use to
*define* these steps:

You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

@Given("today is Sunday")
public void today_is_Sunday() {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}

@When("I ask whether it's Friday yet")

    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}

@Then("I should be told {string}")
public void i_should_be_told(String string) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}
```

{{% block "kotlin" %}}

Unfortunately, Cucumber does not generate snippets in Kotlin. But fortunately IntelliJ can convert the Java code to Kotlin code for you. You might need to improve the translated code, to make it more idiomatic.
You might also need to add the following import statements (if you hadn't already).

Your `StepDefs.kt` file should now look like this:
```kotlin
package hellocucumber

import io.cucumber.java.PendingException
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given
import io.cucumber.java.en.When
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then
import org.junit.Assert.*

class StepDefs {
    @Given("today is Sunday")
    @Throws(Exception::class)
    fun today_is_Sunday() {
        // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
        throw PendingException()
    }

Cucumber found our step definitions and executed them. They are currently marked as
*pending*, which means we need to make them do something useful.

# See scenario reported as failing

The next step is to do what the comments in the step definitions is telling us to do:

> Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions

Try to use the same words in the code as in the steps.

{{% tip "Ubiquitous Language"%}}
If the words in your steps originated from conversations during an
[Example Mapping](/docs/bdd/example-mapping) session, you're building a
[Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html),
which we believe is a great way to make your production code and tests more understandable and easier to maintain.
{{% /tip %}}

Change your step definition code to this:

Congratulations! You've got your first green Cucumber scenario.

# Add another failing test
The next thing to test for would be that we also get the correct result when it *is* Friday.

Update the `is_it_friday_yet.feature` file:
```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"

  Scenario: Friday is Friday
    Given today is Friday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "TGIF"
```

We'll need to add a step definition to set `today` to "Friday":

{{% block "java" %}}
```java
@Given("today is Friday")
public void today_is_Friday() {
    today = "Friday";
}
```
{{% /block %}}

{{% block "kotlin" %}}
```kotlin
@Given("today is Friday")
fun today_is_Friday() {
    today = "Friday"
}
```
{{% /block %}}

```javascript
Given('today is Friday', function () {
  this.today = 'Friday';
});
```

# Using variables and examples
So, we all know that there are more days in the week than just Sunday and Friday. Let's update our scenario to use variables and evaluate more possibilities. We'll use variables and examples to evaluate Friday, Sunday, and anything else!

Update the `is_it_friday_yet.feature` file. Notice how we go from `Scenario` to `Scenario Outline` when we start using multiple `Examples`.
```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario Outline: Today is or is not Friday
    Given today is "<day>"
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "<answer>"

  Examples:
    | day            | answer |
    | Friday         | TGIF   |
    | Sunday         | Nope   |
    | anything else! | Nope   |
```

We need to replace the step definitions for `today is Sunday` and `today is Friday` with one step definition that takes the value of `<day>` as a String.
Update the {{% text "java" %}}`Stepdefs.java`{{% /text %}}{{% text "javascript" %}}`stepdefs.js`{{% /text %}}{{% text "ruby" %}}`stepdefs.rb`{{% /text %}} file as follows:

# Refactoring
Now that we have working code, we should do some refactoring:

* We should move the `isItFriday` {{% stepdef-body %}} out from the test code into production code.

* We could at some point extract helper methods from our step definition, for {{% text "java" %}}methods{{% /text %}}{{% text "kotlin,javascript" %}}functions{{% /text %}}{{% text "ruby" %}}blocks{{% /text %}} we use in several places.

# Summary

In this brief tutorial you've seen how to install Cucumber, how to follow
the BDD process to develop a {{% stepdef-body %}}, and how to use that {{% stepdef-body %}} to evaluate multiple scenarios!
