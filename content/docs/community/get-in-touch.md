If you need help using Cucumber, you have several options.
Wherever you interact with the Cucumber community, always remember to respect and uphold our [code of conduct](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Slack

To access our growing Slack community, you'll need to [register for an account](https://cucumberbdd-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

Once you've received your invite, head over to [#intros](https://cucumberbdd.slack.com/messages/C5WD8SA21) to introduce yourself to the rest of the community, or [#help](https://cucumberbdd.slack.com/messages/C60TKS3SL/) if you need help urgently (or try the help channel for your programming language).
Each channel has a topic, to help you pick the right channel to ask your question.
If you're interested in becoming an open-source contributor, please go to [#the_greenhouse ](https://cucumberbdd.slack.com/messages/C60FTHJ22/). Or just wander around and make yourself at home!
