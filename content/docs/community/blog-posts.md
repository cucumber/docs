Here is a list of Cucumber-related blog posts and tutorials.

Do keep in mind that blogs can become dated quickly with a fast-moving project like Cucumber. Cucumber's documentation should be considered the canonical documentation source with the, hopefully, most up-to-date information. Some very old blog posts may refer to the "RSpec Story Runner", since Cucumber started out as a rewrite of that project.
