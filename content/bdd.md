title: Behaviour-Driven Development
---

Behaviour-Driven development (or BDD) is a software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

BDD focuses on obtaining a clear understanding of desired software behaviour through discussion with stakeholders. It extends [TDD](/tdd-introduction/) by writing test cases in a natural language that non-programmers can read. Behaviour-driven developers use their native language in combination with the ubiquitous language of Domain-Driven design to describe the purpose and benefit of their code. This allows the developers to focus on why the code should be created, rather than the technical details, and minimises translation between the technical language in which the code is written and the domain language spoken by the business, users, stakeholders, project management, etc.

**"Behaviour-driven development is about implementing an application by describing its behavior from the perspective of its stakeholders‚Äù** -- Dan North

The main intention of a BDD framework is to avoid communication gaps between team members, foster better understanding of the customer and promote continuous communication with real world examples.
