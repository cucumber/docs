Cucumber tries to follow the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) specification for release numbers. Essentially, that means that:

* If only the right-hand (patch) number in the release changes, you don't need to worry.
* If the middle number (minor) number in the release changes, you don't need to worry.
* If the left-hand (major) number changes, you can expect that things might break.

You can read the history file to learn about the changes in every release:
