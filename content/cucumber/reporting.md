Cucumber uses reporter plugins to produce reports that contain information about
what scenarios have passed or failed.

Some plugins are built-in, others have to be installed separately. You can also
build your own.

This page documents built-in formatter plugins, the Cucumber Pro plugin, and some common third-party plugins.
Available plugins may vary per programming language.

# Built-in reporter plugins

There are several reporter plugins built into Cucumber:

* `progress`
* `pretty`
* `html`
* `json`
* `rerun`
* `junit`

# Cucumber Pro plugin

This {{% text "java" %}}Cucumber{{% /text %}}{{% text "dotnet" %}}SpecFlow{{% /text %}} plugin publishes
results to [Cucumber Pro](https://cucumber.io/pro).

## Requirements

Your project must be stored in a Git repository, and you must be using one of the
following CI servers:

* [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo)
* [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/)
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)
* [Team Foundation Server (TFS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/)

## Installation

{{% block "java" %}}
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>pro-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>{{% version "propluginjvm" %}}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

(If you're using Gradle or a different build system, declare a similar dependency).

Enable the plugin in the JUnit class you use to run Cucumber:

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"io.cucumber.pro.JsonReporter:default"})
public class RunCucumberTest {
}
```

If you're on Cucumber-JVM 1.2.5 or older, use `io.cucumber.pro.JsonReporter12:default`
instead of `io.cucumber.pro.JsonReporter:default`.

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "dotnet" %}}
Use NuGet to install the plugin into your SpecFlow project:

```shell
PM> Install-Package Cucumber.Pro.SpecFlowPlugin
```
{{% /block %}}

## Configuration

Create a file called `cucumber.yml` in the root directory of your git repository with
the following contents (replace `***` with actual values).

```yaml
cucumberpro:
  # The name of the Cucumber Pro project.
  # You can leave this blank if your Cucumber Pro project name is identical to the
  # CI project name, and you you're using one of Bamboo, Circle CI, TFS, Travis
  # or Wercker.
  projectname: ***
  # The URL of the Cucumber Pro server.
  # You can leave this blank if you are publishing to https://app.cucumber.pro/
  url: ***
```

## Authentication

If you are publishing to https://app.cucumber.pro/ you also have to define
an environment variable named `CUCUMBERPRO_TOKEN` in your CI project. The value
should be your Cucumber Pro project's API token, avaiable from the project
settings page. Consult your CI server's documentation for details about how
to define environment variables.

Authentication is not required on a privately hosted Cucumber Pro Appliance.

## Activation

The plugin will activate itself automatically if it detects that it's running
in one of the supported CI environments. When you run {{% text "java" %}}Cucumber{{% /text %}}{{% text "dotnet" %}}SpecFlow{{% /text %}} from your workstation the plugin will **not**
be activated, and will not publish results.

When you configure the plugin for the first time you can force-activate the plugin
from your work station by defining the following environment variables:

* `GIT_COMMIT` - you can find it by running `git rev-parse HEAD`
* `GIT_BRANCH` - you can find it by running `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`

This is useful for verifying that you have configured the plugin correctly.

## Profiles

If you run {{% text "java" %}}Cucumber{{% /text %}}{{% text "dotnet" %}}SpecFlow{{% /text %}}
several times as part of your build (with different options,
perhaps different tags), you can specify a different *profile name* for each run.
This allows Cucumber Pro to show separate results for each profile.

The profile name can be specified in the `CUCUMBERPRO_PROFILE` environment variable,
which you would typically define in a wrapper script that launches
{{% text "java" %}}Cucumber{{% /text %}}{{% text "dotnet" %}}SpecFlow{{% /text %}}.

{{% block "java" %}}
The profile name can also be specified by appending a colon and a profile name to the
plugin class name:

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"io.cucumber.pro.JsonReporter:smoke"}, tags = "@ui and @smoke")
public class RunCucumberTest {
}
```

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"io.cucumber.pro.JsonReporter:default"}, tags = "not @ui and not @smoke")
public class RunCucumberTest {
}
```
{{% /block %}}

## Advanced configuration

The `cucumber.yml` configuration file has more options that can be overridden for
finer grained control. The defaults are as follows:

```yaml
cucumberpro:
  # The name of the Cucumber Pro project.
  projectname:

  # The project-specific authentication token. You can find it in the project settings (press `?` to display it).
  #
  # Rather than defining the value in this file we recommend defining the `CUCUMBERPRO_TOKEN` environment variable
  # in your CI server.
  #
  # Consult your CI server's documentation for details about defining per-project environment variables.
  # Some CI servers such as Travis and Circle CI allow you to define environment variables in a file checked into git.
  # *DO NOT DO THIS* - as it would allow anyone with read acceess to your repository to publish results.
  token:

  # The plugin sends your local environment variables to Cucumber Pro so it can detect the CI build number,
  # git branch/tag and other information about the build. This mask is a regular expression for filtering
  # out sensitive values that should not be sent to Cucumber Pro.
  envmask: SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD|PWD

  # Sets the log level to one of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR` or `FATAL`. Defaults to `WARN`.
  # Setting it to `DEBUG` will also print the current configuration when the plugin runs.
  logging: INFO

  # Writes out the log messages to the specified file. Useful for debugging.
  logfile:

  # Override this if you are using a privately hosted Cucumber Pro Appliance.
  # We recommend setting this with a CUCUMBERPRO_URL environment variable defined globally on your build server.
  url: https://app.cucumber.pro/

  connection:
    # Set this to false if you want the build to break in case Cucumber Pro is unavailable.
    ignoreerror: true

    # If the http connection for publishing results takes longer than this (milliseconds),
    # time out the connection.
    timeout: 5000
```

You can make some of the settings global by creating a file with global settings.
The plugin will load the configuration in all the following files (if they exist):

{{% block "java" %}}
* `/usr/local/etc/cucumber/cucumber.yml`
* `~/.cucumber/cucumber.yml`
* `~/cucumber.yml`
* `./cucumber.yml` (relative to the git root)
* `./.cucumber/cucumber.yml` (relative to the git root)
{{% /block %}}

{{% block "dotnet" %}}
* `C:\cucumber\cucumber.yml`
* `My Documents\.cucumber\cucumber.yml`
* `My Documents\cucumber.yml`
* `cucumber.yml` (relative to the git root)
* `.cucumber\cucumber.yml` (relative to the git root)
{{% /block %}}

Every setting can also be overridden with environment variables. For example, if you want
the plugin to log more verbosely:

```
# Linux / MacOS
export CUCUMBERPRO_LOGGING=DEBUG

# Windows
SET CUCUMBERPRO_LOGGING=DEBUG
```

{{% block "java" %}}
Alternatively, you can specify a Java system property (in Maven, Gradle or other build tool):

```
-Dcucumberpro.logging=DEBUG
```
{{% /block %}}

# Custom formatters
The Cucumber formatter API is readily extensible. A formatter can be any class implementing the event-based formatter
API. The formatter class should live in the `features/support` directory. To use your custom formatter, run Cucumber
using the `--format` flag:
```
cucumber --format CustomFormatter
```

## Formatter API
Cucumber uses an event-based API for its formatters. These formatters respond to several defined events, with
event handlers defined in the formatter's constructor. A sample formatter could look like this:

{{% block "ruby" %}}

```ruby
class CustomFormatter
  attr_reader :io

  def initialize(config)
    @io = config.out_stream

    # Using a block
    config.on_event :test_step_started do |event|
      io.puts 'Started test step'
    end

    # Passing in a method
    config.on_event :test_step_finished &method(:print_finished)
  end

  def print_finished(event)
    io.puts 'Finished test step'
  end
end
```
{{% /block %}}

### Configuration object
The formatter initializer is passed a `Cucumber::Configuration` object. This is the 
[configuration for the test run](https://docs.cucumber.io/cucumber/configuration/),
including default configurations and [options](https://docs.cucumber.io/cucumber/api/) passed in at the command line.
It can be useful to access these options so that your formatter can modify its behavior in response to user directives.

### Event objects
Every time an event is fired, an event object is passed to the corresponding handler. Each event object belongs to
a class corresponding to its name; for instance, the `gherkin_source_read` event creates a
`Cucumber::Events::GherkinSourceRead` object. Each of these objects provides a different API to access relevant
data such as Gherkin source, feature and step names, and passed/failed status of a step or test case. All events
inherit the methods `#attributes`, `#event_id`, and `#to_h` from the parent class.

#### gherkin_source_read
The `gherkin_source_read` event is fired after the contents of a new feature file have been read. It has two
attributes:
* `path`: The file path of the feature file that has been read
* `body`: The raw Gherkin contained in that file, as a string

#### step_definition_registered
The `step_definition_registered` event is fired after each step definition has been registered. It has one
attribute:
* `step_definition`: The `Cucumber::Glue::StepDefinition` object that has just been registered. This object responds
  to the following instance methods:
    - `#backtrace_line`: The file, line, and step definition that will appear in a backtrace, as in:
      `features/step_definitions/cuke_steps.rb:5:in "this step passes"`
    - `#expression`: The expression used in the step definition, as in `"I have {int} cukes in my belly"` (when a
      Cucumber expression is used) or `/^I have (\d+) cukes in my belly$/` (when a regular expression is used)
    - `#file`: The file where the step definition occurs, as a string, as in `"features/step_definitions/cuke_steps.rb"`
    - `#file_colon_line`: The file and line where the step definition occurs, as a string, as in
      `"features/step_definitions/cuke_steps.rb:5"`
    - `#location`: Alias of `#file_colon_line`
    - `#to_hash`: A hash of data about the step definition, such as `{:source=>{:type=>"cucumber expression", :expression=>"I fail"}, :regexp=>{:source=>"^I fail$", :flags=>""}}`

#### test_run_started
The `test_run_started` event is fired at the beginning of the test run. It has one attribute:
* `test_cases`: The test cases included in the test run. This is an array of `Cucumber::Core::Test::Case` objects. Each
  of these objects responds to the following instance methods:
    - `#all_locations`: Returns an array with the location of each element (feature, scenario, and step) in the feature
      file for the test case.
    - `#all_source`: Returns an array of the features, scenarios, and steps in the test case, as strings, without the keywords
    - `#around_hooks`: Returns an array of the Around hooks associated with that test case
    - `#feature`: Returns the name of the feature for the test case
    - `#keyword`: Returns the Gherkin keyword associated with the test case (`"Feature"`, `"Scenario"`, etc.)
    - `#language`: Returns the language indicated for the test case, as a `Gherkin::Dialect` object
    - `#location`: Returns the location of the first scenario in the test case
    - `#name`: Returns the name of the feature for the test case
    - `#source`: Returns the names of the features and scenarios in the test case, as strings, without the keywords
    - `#step_count`: Returns the integer number of steps in the test case
    - `#tags`: Returns an array of tags for the test case
    - `#test_steps`: Returns an array of the steps in the test case, without the keywords

#### test_run_finished
The `test_run_finished` event is fired after the test run has finished. It has no additional attributes or methods
defined beyond those defined on the base event class (i.e., `#attributes`, `#event_id` and `#to_h`), meaning you cannot
access test cases, Gherkin source, etc. from the handler for this event. This event can be used, for example, to print
the running time of the test suite.

#### test_case_started
The `test_case_started` event is fired when a `Cucumber::Core::Test::Case` is about to be executed. It has one attribute:
* `test_case`: The `Cucumber::Core::Test::Case` object (described above) that is about to be executed.

#### test_case_finished
The `test_case_finished` event is fired when a `Cucumber::Core::Test::Case` has finished executing. It has two attributes:
* `test_case`: The `Cucumber::Core::Test::Case` object (described above) that has just finished
* `result`: The result (passed, failed, pending, skipped) of the test case

#### step_activated
The `step_activated` event is fired when a test step has been activated. It has two attributes:
* `test_step`: The `Cucumber::Core::Test::Step` object (described above) that has been activated
* `step_match`: A `Cucumber::StepMatch` object. This object responds to the following instance methods:
    - `#args`: The arguments passed to the step
    - `#backtrace_line`: The backtrace line from the step definition including the file, line, and step expression
    - `#format_args`: The text of the step
    - `#location`: The step definition file where the step is defined
    - `#step_arguments`: The arguments passed to the step
    - `#step_definition`: The `Cucumber::Glue::StepDefinition` object (described above) corresponding to the step
    - `#text_length`: The number of characters in the step text

#### test_step_started
The `test_step_started` event is fired just before each `Cucumber::Core::Test::Step` is started. It has one attribute:
* `test_step`: The `Cucumber::Core::Test::Step` object that has just started. This object responds to the following
  methods that may be useful for the purposes of your formatter:
    - `#action_location`: The feature file in which the step appears and the location of its scenario within that file,
      in the form `features/file.feature:line`
    - `#location`: The feature file in which the step appears and the location of the step within that file, in the same
      form as described under `#action_location`
    - `#source`: The Gherkin source of the feature file in which the step appears, without keywords
    - `#text`: The text of the step, without the Gherkin keyword

#### test_step_finished
The `test_step_finished` event is fired after each `Cucumber::Core::Test::Step` has finished running. It has two attributes:
* `test_step`: The `Cucumber::Core::Test::Step` object (described above) that has just executed
* `result` The result (passed, failed, pending, skipped) of the test case
