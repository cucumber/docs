It's important to prevent state created by one scenario from leaking into others.
Leaking state makes your scenarios brittle, and difficult to run in isolation.

* Avoid using global or static variables.

* Make sure you clean your database between scenarios.

# Sharing state between steps

It's possible to store object state in variables inside your step definitions.

State can make your steps more tightly coupled and harder to reuse.

## Dependency Injection in Java
If your programming language is Java, you will be writing glue code
([step definitions](/cucumber/#step-definitions) and [hooks](/cucumber/#hooks)) in plain old Java classes.

Cucumber will create a new instance of each of your glue code classes before each scenario.

If all of your glue code classes have an empty constructor, you donâ€™t need anything else.
However, most projects will benefit from a dependency injection (DI) module to organize your code better and to share state between step definitions.

The available dependency injection modules are:

- [PicoContainer](#picocontainer) (The recommended one if your application doesn't use another DI module)
- [Spring](#spring)
- [Guice](#guice)
- [OpenEJB](#openejb)
- [Weld](#weld)
- [Needle](#needle)

### PicoContainer

To use PicoContainer, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-picocontainer</artifactId>
    <version>{{% version "cucumberjvm" %}}}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Or, if you are using Gradle, add:
```
compile group: 'io.cucumber', name: 'cucumber-picocontainer', version: '{{% version "cucumberjvm" %}}}'
```

There is no documentation yet, but the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/picocontainer).

# Databases

## The Before Hook Approach

The recommended approach to clean a database between scenarios is to use a
`Before`[Hook](/cucumber/#hooks) to remove all data *before* a scenario starts.

This is usually better than using an `After`[hook](/cucumber/#hooks), as it allows
you to perform a post-mortem inspection of the database if a scenario fails.

An alternative approach is to use database transactions.

## The Database Transaction Approach

If your database supports it, you can wrap a transaction *around* each scenario.

This might lead to faster scenarios, but it comes at a cost.
You won't be able to perform a post-mortem, and you won't be able to
use [browser automation](#browser-automation-and-transactions).

To use this approach, you need to tell Cucumber to start a transaction in a `Before`[hook](/cucumber/#hooks), and later
roll it back in an `After`[hook](/cucumber/#hooks).

This is such a common thing to do that several Cucumber extensions provide ready-to-use
[tagged hooks](/cucumber/#tagged-hooks) using a tag named `@txn`.

To enable it, you must tag every [feature](/gherkin/#feature) or [scenario](/gherkin/#example) that requires
transactions with `@txn`:

```gherkin
@txn
Feature: Let's write a lot of stuff to the DB

  Scenario: I clean up after myself
    Given I write to the DB

  Scenario: And so do I!
    Given I write to the DB
```

### With JUnit and Spring

The [`cucumber-spring`](#dependency-injection-in-java) module contains `@txn` hooks in the `cucumber.api.spring` package.

This package isn't on your glue path by default, so you have to add it yourself in your
Cucumber Options.

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(glue = {"your.own.glue.code", "cucumber.api.spring"})
public class RunCukesTest {
}
```

See the [`spring-txn`](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/spring-txn) example in Cucumber-JVM for a minimal setup.

# Browser Automation and Transactions

If you're using a [browser automation](/browser-automation/) tool that talks to your application over HTTP the transactional approach
will not work if your [step definitions](/cucumber/#step-definitions) and the web application serving HTTP request each have their own database connection.

If this is the case you should use the brute-force approach where the data is explicitly deleted before each scenario.
