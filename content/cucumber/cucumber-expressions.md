Cucumber uses *expressions* to link a [Gherkin Step](/gherkin/reference#steps)
to a [Step Definition](/cucumber/step-definitions). You can use
[Regular Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) or *Cucumber Expressions*.

Cucumber Expressions offer similar functionality to Regular Expressions, with a syntax 
that is easier to read and write. Cucumber Expressions are also
extensible with *parameter types*.

# Introduction

Let's write a Cucumber Expression that matches the following Gherkin step (the `Given`
keyword has been removed here, as it's not part of the match).

    I have 42 cucumbers in my belly

The simplest Cucumber Expression that matches that text would be the text itself,
but we can also write a more generic expression, with an `int` *output parameter*:

    I have {int} cucumbers in my belly

When the text is matched against that expression, the number `42` is extracted
from the `{int}` output parameter and passed as an argument to the [step definition](/cucumber/step-definitions).

The following text would not match the expression:

    I have 42.5 cucumbers in my belly

This is because `42.5` has a decimal part, and doesn't fit into an `int`.
Let's change the output parameter to `float` instead:

    I have {float} cucumbers in my belly

Now the expression will match the text, and the float `42.5` is extracted.

# Parameter types

Text between curly braces reference a *parameter type*. Cucumber comes with
the following built-in parameter types:

{.table .is-bordered}
Parameter Type  | Description
----------------|------------:
`{int}`         | Matches integers, for example `71` or `-19`.
`{float}`       | Matches floats, for example `3.6`, `.8` or `-9.2`.
`{word}`        | Matches words without whitespace, for example `banana` (but not `banana split`)
`{string}`      | Matches single-quoted or double-quoted strings, for example `"banana split"` or `'banana split'` (but not `banana split`). Only the text between the quotes will be extracted. The quotes themselves are discarded.
`{}` anonymous  | Matches anything (`/.*/`). 

{{% block "java" %}}
On the JVM, there are additional parameter types for `biginteger`, `bigdecimal`,
`byte`, `short`, `long` and `double`. The anonymous parameter type will be 
converted to the parameter type of the step definition.
{{% /block %}}

# Custom Parameter types

Cucumber Expressions can be extended so they automatically convert
output parameters to your own types. Consider this Cucumber Expression:

    I have a {color} ball

If we want the `{color}` output parameter to be converted to a `Color` object,
we can define a custom parameter type in Cucumber's [configuration](/cucumber/configuration).

{{% block "java" %}}
```java
typeRegistry.defineParameterType(new ParameterType<>(
    "color",           // name
    "red|blue|yellow", // regexp
    Color.class,       // type
    Color::new         // transformer function
))
```
{{% /block %}}

{{% block "javascript" %}}
```javascript
const { defineParameterType } = require('cucumber')

defineParameterType(new ParameterType<>(
    'color',           // name
    /red|blue|yellow/, // regexp
    Color,             // type
    s => new Color(s)  // transformer function
))
```

The `transformer` function may return a `Promise`.

{{% /block %}}

{{% block "ruby" %}}
```ruby
ParameterType(
  name:        'color',
  regexp:      /red|blue|yellow/,
  type:        Color,
  transformer: ->(s) { Color.new(s) }
)
```
{{% /block %}}

The table below explains the various arguments you can pass when defining
a parameter type.

{.table .is-bordered}
Argument      | Description
--------------|------------:
`name`        | The name the parameter type will be recognised by in output parameters.
`regexp`      | A regexp that will match the parameter. May include capture groups.
`type`        | The return type of the transformer {{% stepdef-body %}}.
`transformer` | A {{% stepdef-body %}} that transforms the match from the regexp. Must have arity 1 if the regexp doesn't have any capture groups. Otherwise the arity must match the number of capture groups in `regexp`.
{{% text "java,javascript" %}}`useForSnippets`{{% /text %}}{{% text "ruby" %}}`use_for_snippets`{{% /text %}} | Defaults to `true`. That means this parameter type will be used to generate snippets for undefined steps. If the `regexp` frequently matches text you don't intend to be used as arguments, disable its use for snippets with `false`.
{{% text "java,javascript" %}}`preferForRegexpMatch`{{% /text %}}{{% text "ruby" %}}`prefer_for_regexp_match`{{% /text %}} | Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` if you have step definitions that use regular expressions, and you want this parameter type to take precedence over others during a match.

# Optional text

It's grammatically incorrect to say *1 cucumbers*, so we should make the plural **s**
optional. That can be done by surrounding the optional text with parenthesis:

    I have {int} cucumber(s) in my belly

That expression would match this text:

    I have 1 cucumber in my belly

It would also match this text:

    I have 42 cucumbers in my belly

In Regular Expressions, parenthesis means capture group, but in Cucumber Expressions
it means *optional text*.

# Alternative text

Sometimes you want to relax your language, to make it flow better. For example:

    I have {int} cucumber(s) in my belly/stomach

This would match either of those texts:

    I have 42 cucumbers in my belly
    I have 42 cucumbers in my stomach

Alternative text only works when there is no whitespace between the alternative parts.

# Escaping

If you ever need to match `()` or `{}` literally, you can escape the
opening `(` or `{` with a double backslash:

    I have 42 \\{what} cucumber(s) in my belly \\(amazing!)

This expression would match the following examples:

    I have 42 {what} cucumber in my belly (amazing!)
    I have 42 {what} cucumbers in my belly (amazing!)

There is currently no way to escape a `/` character - it will always be interpreted
as alternative text.
