title: Examples

Good BDD examples are *concrete* rather than *abstract*. They mention names of 
people and places, exact dates and amounts, and anything that is relevant to the
problem domain of the software.

Good examples don't mention technical details.

{{% note "Imagine it's 1922" %}}
Most software does something people could do manually (just not as efficiently).

Try hard to come up with examples that don't make any assumptions about
technology. Imagine it's 1922, when there were no computers.
