As Cucumber runs your features, it calls out to any number of listener objects to let them know how it's progressing. These listeners are notified at various points throughout the run of features. You can visualise this by using the 'debug' formatter. For example, take this simple scenario in Cucumber's own test suite:

    $ head -7 examples/self_test/features/sample.feature
    # Feature comment
    @one
    Feature: Sample

      @two @three
      Scenario: Missing
        Given missing

Here are the events fired to a listener when that scenario is run, shown using the debug formatter:

    $ cucumber --format debug examples/self_test/sample.feature:6
    before_features
      before_feature
        before_comment
          comment_line
        after_comment
        before_tags
          tag_name
        after_tags
        feature_name
        before_feature_element
          before_tags
            tag_name
            tag_name
          after_tags
          scenario_name
          before_steps
            before_step
              before_step_result
                step_name
              after_step_result
            after_step
          after_steps
        after_feature_element
      after_feature
    after_features

If you want to write your own custom formatter, just create a class that implements any of the methods you see in the output from the debug formatter. Let's illustrate this with an example.

Maybe you want to create a formatter that posts a message to Twitter every time a step fails? (I'm sure that would get you a lot of followers).

Here is how you'd do that:

Save your custom formatter class in <code>features/support</code> (or if you want to put it elsewhere, put a file in that directory that <code>require</code>s your formatter class).

    # features/support/twitter_formatter.rb
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'twitter'

    module Silly
      class TwitterFormatter
        def initialize(step_mother, io, options)
          # We don't care about these - we're just twittering!
        end

        def step_name(keyword, step_match, status, source_indent, background, file_colon_line)
          if status == :failed
            step_name = step_match.format_args(lambda{|param| "*#{param}*"})
            message = "#{step_name} FAILED"
            Twitter::Base.new('your email', 'your password').post(message)
          end
        end
      end
    end

Now you can run your features by passing <code>-~~format Silly::TwitterFormatter</code> to the <code>cucumber</code> command line, Rake task or even in <code>cucumber.yml</code>~~ see \[\[Running Features\]\] for all the options. You have more methods available than the ones used in this awesome example (but you only need to implement the ones you care about). Look at the sources for some of Cucumber's built-in formatters to discover more methods.

If your formatter can't be found
--------------------------------

If cucumber complains that it can't find your formatter, add an explicit <code>--require dir</code>, where <code>dir</code> is a parent directory of your formatter. You can also pass the full path to the ruby file where the formatter is defined.

The cucumber <code>--help</code> states:

bq.. Automatic loading is disabled when this option is specified, and all loading becomes explicit. Files under directories named "support" are always loaded first.

This means that you have to add your <code>support</code> folder to <code>--require dir</code> for it to be loaded.
