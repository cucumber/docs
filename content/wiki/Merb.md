Install
-------

Cucumber can be used with [Merb](http://merbivore.com/) via the [merb\_cucumber](http://github.com/roman/merb_cucumber) plugin.

To install merb\_cucumber:

    sudo gem install david-merb_cucumber

Or you can install [jsmestad-merb\_cucumber](http://github.com/jsmestad/merb_cucumber)

    sudo gem install jsmestad-merb_cucumber

Here is a brief note from jsmestad.

> Note – you must uninstall david-merb\_cucumber in order for this gem to take precedence. Merb + Cucumber + Webrat testing stack. Builds upon David’s work, but binds Webrat as a dependency to hopefully ensure a smooth upgrade for future Webrat releases. Also Factory\_Girl generators will be added soon.

Here's a better one

    sudo gem install roman-merb_cucumber

> Note – both justin's and david's merb\_cucumber forks didnt work for me (they don't seem to use the bundled directory). Try Roman's

Usage
-----

The inside of a merb application directory, try:

    merb-gen cucumber
    merb-gen feature FEATURE_NAME

Edit your feature, and:

    rake features

Tips
----

Describe can use multiple given blocks

For example, you can [now](http://ln-s.net/2vB2)
(since Feb 26, 2009 commit by carllerche) write

    <code>
    given "some food" do
      @food = "pizza"
    end

    given "some drink" do
      @drink = "beer"
    end

    describe "Something", :given => ["some food", "some drink"] do
      it "should have dinner" do
        # has @food and @drink set to pizza and beer, respectively
      end
    end
    </code>

Looking for Examples?
---------------------

So am I. Therefore I've been scrounging github in search of some. There are many merb projects out there with empty /features sitting around so searching github can potentially return many false positives.

But, please add some when you find them!

Here are some merb projects that use cucumber (feel free to add/update/delete this list accordingly, I did not rigorously weed through each one but I did only include /features that had actual substantial or interesting/creative examples):
