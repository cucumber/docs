[WatirCraft](http://wiki.github.com/bret/watircraft) is a testing framework that
builds on Watir. It allows tests to be expressed as Rspec or Cucumber tests and
provides a library structure to support maintainable testing.

It includes a [Page](http://wiki.github.com/bret/watircraft/pages) class that
allows you to maintain all your Watir html references in one spot, among other
features.
