<a href='http://wiki.github.com/bret/watircraft'>WatirCraft</a> is a testing framework that builds on Watir. It allows tests to be expressed as Rspec or Cucumber tests and provides a library structure to support maintainable testing.

It includes a <a href='http://wiki.github.com/bret/watircraft/pages'>Page</a> class that allows you to maintain all your Watir html references in one spot, among other features.
