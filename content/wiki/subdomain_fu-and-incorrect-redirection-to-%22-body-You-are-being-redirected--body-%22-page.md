This is related to problem described in this [ticket](https://webrat.lighthouseapp.com/projects/10503/tickets/168-redirects-in-rails-23-not-being-followed-by-webrat). We faced this problem in webrat <b>0.7</b> while using with subdomain\_fu.
<b>Solution.</b>
Defining tld\_sizes for subdomain\_fu solved this problem.
Create a file called subdomain\_fu.rb under config/initializers with following content.
SubdomainFu.tld\_sizes = {
:development =&gt; 0, :test =&gt; 1, :production =&gt; 1, :cucumber =&gt; 1
}

Another error <b>You have a nil object when you didn't expect it! </b> when using subdomain with mail url.
