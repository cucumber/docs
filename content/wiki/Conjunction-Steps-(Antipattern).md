From the online Merriam-Webster dictionary:

> **con·junc·tion** :an uninflected linguistic form that joins together sentences, clauses, phrases, or words

Don't do this in steps. It makes steps too specialised and hard to reuse. Cucumber has built-in support for conjunctions (And, But) for a reason.

Example
-------

    Given I have shades and a brand new Mustang

How to fix
----------

    Given I have shades
    And I have a brand new Mustang

When conjunction steps are OK
-----------------------------

Sometimes you may want to combine several steps into one to make your scenarios easier to read. \[\[Calling Steps from Step Definitions\]\] makes this possible, but make your life simpler by making the called steps atomic.
