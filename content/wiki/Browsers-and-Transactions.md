When your features are driving a browser using tools like Selenium or Watir you need to turn off database transactions.

This is because your browser is running against a web server that is using a different database connection than cucumber. This is because they run in separate processes. Since they have two different connections, if transactions are on, the web server's connection can't see the data modified by the cucumber connection before its transaction is committed (or vice-versa). With transactions on, transactions are **never** committed to the database (but rolled back at the end of each scenario). Therefore, the web server's connection will never see data from cucumber, and therefore your browser won't either. Likewise, cucumber's connection won't see data from the web server.

If you're using \[\[Ruby on Rails\]\] it's easy to turn off transactions for a feature or particular scenarios. Just use the <code>@no-txn</code> tag, e.g.

    @no-txn
    Feature: Lots of scenarios with transactions off.

or

    Feature: ...
      @no-txn
      Scenario: One scenario with transactions off.

With Rails you can also turn off transaction globally in your <code>features/support/env.rb</code>:

    Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = false

Cleaning Your Database

Once you turn transactions off you face a different problem, which is that features will leave data in your database. If you're using \[\[Ruby on Rails\]\], a good tool to deal with this is Ben Mabey's [Database Cleaner](http://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner) gem which you can install with <code>gem install bmabey-database\_cleaner --source http://gems.github.com/</code>. (Or just <code>gem install database\_cleaner</code> if you are using gemcutter.) You can use this very effectively with the <code>@no-txn</code> tag. Something like the following somewhere in e.g. <code>features/support/db\_cleaner.rb</code> should work well:

    require 'database_cleaner'
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with :truncation # clean once to ensure clean slate
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation

    Before('@no-txn') do
      DatabaseCleaner.start
    end

    After('@no-txn') do
      DatabaseCleaner.clean
    end

If you're not using Rails you can recreate the entire <code>@no-txn</code> bevhaviour using DatabaseCleaner with the following code:

    # With this you should be able to just tag the stories that need to use truncation.
    # Otherwise, the transaction strategy will be used all the other times.

    require 'database_cleaner'
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with :truncation # clean once to ensure clean slate
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction # use transactions by default

    Before('@no-txn') do
      DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
    end

    Before do
      DatabaseCleaner.start
    end

    After do
      DatabaseCleaner.clean
    end

    After('@no-txn') do
      DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
    end
