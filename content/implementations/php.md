# Behat

Behat is the official Cucumber implementation for PHP.

The docs are currently at [behat.org](http://behat.org).

According to http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/ bq. Since v3.0, Behat is considered
an official Cucumber implementation in PHP and is part of one big family of BDD
tools.

## Directly testing PHP code


To directly test PHP code using step definitions written in PHP, please see the [Cuke4Php](https://github.com/olbrich/cuke4php) project.

Testing against PHP web applications
------------------------------------

Most people seem to use cucumber for rails and most of the howtos and documents on the web reflect this. But cucumber is a great tool for testing any kind of web application, no matter what language it was built in. We could use Selenium, and there are good [how-to's](http://wiki.github.com/cucumber/cucumber/setting-up-selenium) for that - but Selenium is slow and clunky to setup, and should only be used if you need to test JavaScript. What if I want to write BDD stories and test a PHP app with cucumber?

Turns out it is easier than I expected. Webrat has options for interfacing with a web application using rails, selenium or mechanize. All we have to do is tell webrat to use mechanize and most things will work exactly the same as in any other cucumber setup.

Here is how to do it:

    <code>
      Scenario: Install cucumber
        Given I am running Ubuntu
        And I have not yet installed cucumber
        When I run "apt-get install ruby ruby1.8-dev rdoc1.8 irb libxml2-dev \
          libxslt1-dev libc6-dev-i386 libopenssl-ruby"
        # We install rubygems by hand because the apt version uses strange paths
        And I run "wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz"
        And I run "tar xvf rubygems-1.3.5.tgz"
        And I run "cd rubygems-1.3.5"
        And I run "sudo ruby setup.rb"
        # Add github's gem source list
        And I run "gem sources -a http://gems.github.com"
        And I run "sudo gem install cucumber mechanize rspec webrat"
        Then I have installed cucumber

      Scenario: Setup a cucumber environment for your php app
        Given I have a php app that is running
        And I am in the app's top level directory
        When I create a "features" directory
        And I create a "features/support" directory
        And I create a "features/step_definitions" directory
        And I put the following in "features/support/env.rb"
    </code>

    <code>
    # RSpec
    require 'rspec/expectations'

    # Webrat
    require 'webrat'

    require 'test/unit/assertions'
    World(Test::Unit::Assertions)

    Webrat.configure do |config|
      config.mode = :mechanize
    end

    World do
      session = Webrat::Session.new
      session.extend(Webrat::Methods)
      session.extend(Webrat::Matchers)
      session
    end
    </code>

    <code>
        Then I can write cucumber tests and execute them
    </code>

A few other gotchas:

The mechanize configuration for webrat seems to use response\_body instead of
response.body. I am not sure what is going on there, but when using the webrat
step definitions from: http://github.com/brynary/webrat required a few
substitutions to make it work right.

If you want your test data to be the same every time your run it, you need a few
things. First, you need a separate database that has a known and controlled set
of data in it. Secondly, if your data is different every time you test, then
your tests probably are not repeatable.

To get around this you can hack in database dumps and table dumps to happen
before and after scenarios. You can save database state before all of the tests
and reload it at the end so that next time it will be the same, or you can do it
on a per feature level and per database table level. I have so far found the
second approach to be the quickest and most flexible.

The per feature and per table approach can be accomplished using \[\[hooks\]\].
Here are is the code that I currently have in 'support/hooks.rb'

```
    Before ('@reset_users') do
      # Save user table data
      save_table("game_user")
    end

    After ('@reset_users') do
      # Reload user table data
      load_table("game_user")
    end

    def save_table(table_name)
      run "mysqldump -u #{@@test_database_username} --password=#{@@test_database_password} \
        #{@@test_database_name} #{table_name}> /tmp/#{table_name}"

    end

    def load_table(table_name)
      run "mysql -u #{@@test_database_username} --password=#{@@test_database_password} \
        #{@@test_database_name} < /tmp/#{table_name}"
    end
```

Then you can just put the @reset\_users tag in before the scenario that does
stuff with your user table, and it will reset it after it completes:

    <code>
      @reset_users
      Scenario: Create a user
        Given ...
    </code>
