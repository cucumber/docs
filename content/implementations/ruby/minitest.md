You can also use [minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) `assert` methods by defining your own [World](/wiki/a-whole-new-world/) block:

# Minitest 5

```ruby
require 'minitest/spec'

class MinitestWorld
include Minitest::Assertions
attr\_accessor :assertions

def initialize
self.assertions = 0
end
end

World do
MinitestWorld.new
end
```

Or, if that causes problems, try:

```ruby
World(MultiTest::MinitestWorld)
```

# Older versions

```ruby
require 'mini/test'

World do |world|
world.extend(MiniTest::Assertions)
world
end
```

If it doesn't work, try this one:

```ruby
require 'minitest/unit'

World do
extend MiniTest::Assertions
end
```

Or

```ruby
require 'minitest/unit'
World(MiniTest::Assertions)
```

Also, if you wanted to use `MiniTest::Spec`, the snippet would look like this:

```ruby
require 'minitest/spec'
World(MiniTest::Assertions)
MiniTest::Spec.new(nil)
```
