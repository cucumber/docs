The [Cucumber-Sinatra](https://github.com/bernd/cucumber-sinatra) gem will generate a `features/` directory structure and `features/support/env.rb` in your Sinatra project pre-configured for testing with Cucumber, [RSpec](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec), and [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).

This gem is inspired by the [Cucumber-Rails](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails) generator.

# Webrat

You can use Cucumber with [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) and [Webrat](https://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master)!

Just make sure you have a `features/support/env.rb` file with the following:

```
app_file = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), *%w[.. .. app.rb])
require app_file
# Force the application name because polyglot breaks the auto-detection logic.
Sinatra::Application.app_file = app_file

require 'rspec/expectations'
require 'rack/test'
require 'webrat'

Webrat.configure do |config|
  config.mode = :rack
end

class MyWorld
  include Rack::Test::Methods
  include Webrat::Methods
  include Webrat::Matchers

  Webrat::Methods.delegate_to_session :response_code, :response_body

  def app
    Sinatra::Application
  end
end

World{MyWorld.new}
```

You may have to set the `app_file` in your app file so that Sinatra can find the views and layouts.

You also need to specify the `:public` directory, even if you're on default. Otherwise, stylesheets and javascripts won't be available to your Cucumber session.

```
# In your main application file
configure do
  set :views, "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/views"
  set :public, "#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/public"
end
```

# Sinatra/Test

You can also use Cucumber with [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) using Sinatra's built-in [testing setup](http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html) and [Test Harness](http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html#using_).

Make sure you have something like the the following, [tailored](http://www.sinatrarb.com/testing.html#frameworks) to `Test::Unit`, `RSpec`, `Bacon`, or `Test::Spec`, in your `features/support/env.rb`.

```
require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../your_sinatra_app"

# RSpec matchers
require 'rspec/expectations'

# Required for RSpec to play nice with Sinatra/Test
require 'rspec/interop/test'

# Sinatra/Test
require 'sinatra/test'

Test::Unit::TestCase.send :include, Sinatra::Test

World do
  Sinatra::TestHarness.new(Sinatra::Application)
end
```

# Rack-Test

You can also use Cucumber with [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) using Bryan Helkamp's [rack-test](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test) and [Webrat](https://github.com/brynary/webrat).

You can check out the rspec examples in the [hancock application](https://github.com/atmos/hancock).

Something like the following should be setup in your `features/support/env.rb`.

```
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)+'/../../spec_helper')
require 'haml'

MyApp::App.set :environment, :development

World do
  def app
    @app = Rack::Builder.new do
      run MyApp::App
    end
  end
  include Rack::Test::Methods
  include Webrat::Methods
  include Webrat::Matchers
end
```
