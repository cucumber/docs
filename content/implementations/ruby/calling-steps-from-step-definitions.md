title: Calling Steps from Step Definitions
---

It is possible to call steps from [step definitions](/step-definitions/):

```
# ruby
Given /^the user (.*) exists$/ do |name|
  # ...
end

Given /^I log in as (.*)$/ do |name|
  # ...
end

Given /^(.*) is logged in$/ do |name|
  step "the user #{name} exists"
  step "I log in as #{name}"
end
```

As of version 0.4.4, you can also do this:

```
Given /^(.*) is logged in$/ do |name|
  # Look ma, no quotes!
  # Easier to do "extract steps from plain text" refactorings with cut and paste!
  steps %Q{
    Given the user #{name} exists
    Given I log in as #{name}
  }
end
```

Invoking steps from step definitions is practical if you have several common steps that you want to perform in several scenariosâ€”or, if you want to make your scenarios shorter and more declarative.

This allows you to do this in a scenario:

```
# feature
Scenario: View last incidents
  Given Linda is logged in # This will in fact invoke 2 step definitions
  When I go to the incident page
```

Instead of having a lot of repetition:

```
# feature
Scenario: View last incidents
  Given the user Linda exists
  And I log in as Linda
  When I go to the incident page
```

# Calling steps with multiline step arguments

Sometimes you want to call a step that has been designed to take multiline [step arguments](/gherkin/#step-arguments) and sometimes you want to call a step that has been designed to take [multiline strings](#doc-strings).
For example:

## Tables

```
# ruby
Given /^an expense report for (.*) with the following posts:$/ do |date, posts_table|
  # The posts_table variable is an instance of Cucumber::Ast::Table
end
```

This can easily be called from a plain text step like this:

```
# feature
Given an expense report for Jan 2009 with the following posts:
  | account | description | amount |
  | INT-100 | Taxi        |    114 |
  | CUC-101 | Peeler      |     22 |
```

But what if you want to call this from a step definition?

There are a couple of ways to do this:

```
# ruby
Given /A simple expense report/ do
  step "an expense report for Jan 2009 with the following posts:", table(%{
    | account | description | amount |
    | INT-100 | Taxi        |    114 |
    | CUC-101 | Peeler      |     22 |
  })
end
```

Or, if you prefer a more programmatic approach:

```
# ruby
Given /A simple expense report/ do
  step "an expense report for Jan 2009 with the following posts:", table([
    %w{ account description amount },
    %w{ INT-100 Taxi        114    },
    %w{ CUC-101 Peeler      22     }
  ])
end
```

You can also simply receive a table and pass it down. This Spanish step definition passes its table to the English one:

```
# ruby
Entonces /^debo ver los links:$/ do |links_table|
  Then "I should see the links:", links_table
end

Then /^I should see the links:$/ do |links_table|
  links_table.hashes.each do |hash|
    Then "I should see the link #{hash['link']}"
  end
end
```

## Doc Strings

To call a step that takes a multiline string, such as

```
# ruby
Given /^I fill in "([^\"]*)" with$/ do |field, pystring|
  fill_in(field, :with => pystring)
end
```

From a step definition, pass the string after the step:

```
# ruby
Given /^a document exists with content$/ do |pystring|
  step "I go to add a document"
  step 'I fill in "ditacontent" with', pystring
  step  'I press "Add to repository"'
end
```
