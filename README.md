# Cucumber Documentation

This repository contains the source code for [https://cucumber.io/docs](https://cucumber.io/docs).

## Contributing Content

For small edits, the recommended way to contribute is via GitHub.
Each page in the documentation will have an **Edit** link for this purpose.

## Working locally

For bigger modifications, the recommended workflow is to edit the documentation
locally on your machine, and seeing the results in a web browser.

This involves getting the source code and building the documentation yourself.

# Get the source code

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber/docs.cucumber.io.git
    cd docs.cucumber.io

### View the site

The website is built with several tools that are distributed as a Docker image.

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) if you don't already have
it on your machine.

Build and serve the website:

    ./docker_shell.sh

Open a browser:

    http://localhost:1313

Changes to the contents will be automatically updated in the browser.

Try editing one of the pages under `content` and see for yourself!

### Build the site and check links

When you are done editing, build the site and check links:

    ./docker_shell.sh make clean
    ./docker_shell.sh make
    ./docker_shell.sh make htmlproofer

By default, external links are only checked in CI (because it takes a while).
To check external links locally:

    CI=true ./docker_shell.sh make htmlproofer

Links that are broken should be removed or replaced, even if they are only
temporarily broken. The reason for this is that broken links negatively affect
search engine rankings.

### Modify theme

See the [theme README](themes/cucumber-hugo/README.md)

## Architecture

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast static site generator.

We have a custom-built theme for the site in `themes/cucumber-hugo`. This theme
is based on [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - a lightweight CSS framework.

The online site is rebuild automatically whenever the git repository receives
new commits, either via a `git push`, or by modifying contents in the CMS.

The [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) saves contents straight to GitHub
using the GitHub API.

## Continuous Deployment

GitHub will notify Netlify for every `git push` thanks to a [webhook](https://github.com/cucumber/docs.cucumber.io/settings/hooks).

Netlify will then build the site and
[deploy](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cucumber/deploys) it if the build is successful.

The build will check for broken links and other problems. Internal and external links are checked by [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer).
Occasionally, the build will fail due to external links being unavailable or giving a timeout. When that happens, please check if these external links are available and if so, 'Retry build' on Netlify.

You can discuss the documentation in the `#docs` Slack channel. Build notifications are sent to the `#bots-docs` Slack channel. See https://cucumber.io/support for details on how to access Slack.
