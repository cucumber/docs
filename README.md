# Cucumber Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the Cucumber Documentation website.
It is currently live at [https://cucumber.netlify.com](https://cucumber.netlify.com),
and the plan is to move it to [https://docs.cucumber.io](https://docs.cucumber.io) once
it is good enough to replace the existing documentation.

## Old documentation

For various reasons, old Cucumber documentation is scattered around different places:

* 2008 onwards: [Cucumber wiki (primarily Ruby)](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki)
* 2008 onwards: Misc README files for different implementations:
  * https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby
  * https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm
  * https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js
* 2015 onwards: [https://cucumber.io/docs](https://cucumber.io/docs)
  * Based on our own website app (Jekyll-like)
  * [source](https://github.com/cucumber/website/tree/master/apps/dynamic/views/docs)
* 2016 onwards: [https://docs.cucumber.io/](https://docs.cucumber.io/)
  * Based on GitBook
  * [source](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber)
  * See [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) for the outline

The goal is to move the documentation to this repo.

When the new website is ready to go live, we should replace contents on old pages
with a link and/or redirect to the new location, so that external links to the old documentation remain useful.

## Contributing Content

The easiest way to contribute content is to add or modify content in the
[Netlify CMS](https://cucumber.netlify.com/admin).

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and edit Markdown files in a text
editor on your local machine

## Working locally

If you want to modify layout, or prefer to work in a text editor you need to
install some software.

### Get the source code

Fork this repo to your own account and clone it to your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/<your username here>/docs.cucumber.io.git
    cd docs.cucumber.io

### Install the software (Mac)

    brew install git hugo

### Run the site locally

Start the server:

    hugo server --buildDrafts

Open a browser:

    http://localhost:1313

### Modify content

Simply edit Markdown files under `content`.

Whenever you make a change to the content, the server will automatically rebuild the site (in a few milliseconds) and tell the browser to reload (using a WebSocket).

### Modify theme

Edit files under `themes/cucumber-hugo`. Changes to the CSS should be made in
`themes/cucumber-hugo/static/css/cucumber.sass`.

If you make changes to the `sass`, it will be rebuilt if you run the following:

    cd themes/cucumber-hugo
    yarn        # install dependencies
    yarn watch  # rebuild cucumber.css

A rebuild of the CSS will trigger a reload of the browser, just like with content.

### Create pull request for your changes
Create a pull request for your changes on your remote repo to the master/origin repo


## Architecture

The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a fast static site generator.

We have a custom-built theme for the site in `themes/cucumber-hugo`. This theme
is based on [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) - a lightweight CSS framework.

The online site is rebuild automatically whenever the git repository receives
new commits, either via a `git push`, or by modifying contents in the CMS.

The [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) saves contents straight to GitHub
using the GitHub API.

We might experiment with [other CMS systems](https://headlesscms.org/) if Netlify
CMS doesn't fit with our workflow.

## Continuous Deployment

GitHub will notify Netlify for every `git push` via a [webhook](thanks to a [webhook](https://github.com/cucumber/docs.cucumber.io/settings/hooks)).

Netlify will then build the site
[deploy](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cucumber/deploys) it if the build is successful.

The build will check for broken links and other problems.

Build notifications are sent to the `#cucumber-docs-bots` Slack channel. See
https://cucumber.io/support for details on how to access Slack.
