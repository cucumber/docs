Thank you for helping make Cucumber better!

Cucumber's success is owed to the hundreds of people who have contributed new
features and bug fixes. Let's not forget the people who have offered help on the
mailing list and chat rooms, and improved the documentation.

If you want to support those people financially you can learn more on the
[[Open Collective]] page.

## Contributing via GitHub

Cucumber is open source, and the source code is hosted on GitHub. Bug fixes,
new features and improvements to the documentation are all done via GitHub.

Contributors fall into four categories

* First-time contributors
* Committers
* Core team
* Financial backers

### Financial backing

Let's start with the financials. Maintaining and improving the Cucumber project
takes a lot of effort, and contributors spend a lot on time on fixing bugs,
adding features, documenting and assisting users through online forums.

In order to incentivise individuals to spend time working on Cucumber, we need
to remove obstacles to do so. If we reward them financially we can attract more
contributors beyond the few contributors who are able and willing to contribute
without being paid.

Every contributor can submit an expense report for a piece of work they have completed,
as soon as it ends up on the master branch. The expense will then be paid as long
as there is money in the kitty. If the kitty runs out of money, then some contributors
may stop contributing.

This is where you can help. By making a regular donation to the Cucumber project,
you help secure the future quality and usefulness of Cucumber. In addition to
giving you a better product, we also list all financial contributors.

Companies or individuals donating over a certain sum will be listed highest up,
with their logo or portrait.

### First-time contributors

We've got a sweet deal for you! When you get your first contribution approved,
you immediately become a committer. Now you can get your contributions merged faster
(you can do it yourself once a core team member has approved it). After a while
you may be invited to join the core team

When you contribute for the first time you first have to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository you
want to contribute to and then submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).

If you know what you want to contribute, it's often a good idea to have a discussion
about it first, either in a GitHub issue, or on the mailing list.

If you don't know what to contribute, check out the list of open issues that
are suitable for newcomers.

### Committers

At Cucumber we have a liberal policy for granting access to the main repository (commit bit).
